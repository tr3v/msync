Nothing special just a script file.

Requierments:
rsync   (install with "apt-get install rsync" or "yum install rsync" or whatever)
python  (this is a python script and needs python, install with "apt-get install python" or "yum install python" .etc)

To install:
For simplicity, copy the msync file to a binary location in your PATH e.g.: 
  ~/bin
  /usr/bin
  .etc

or just run from it's directory each time

In order to run you will first need to make the script executable using "chmod +x msync"
